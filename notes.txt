IconEditorDialog++

LabelledSpinHex - as is
ARGBSetterWidget - as is
ColourButton - as is

IconEditor -> IconEditorScroll
Simply add both H and V scrollbars;

IconEditorDialog -> IconEditorDialogPP
Add save and load modal popup dialogs; set titlebar to name
of current icon; Add widget for setting zoom level;

All of the above: improve on the sizing, resizing, positioning, and maybe
add some themeability.

So far so good - I got the basic layout from IconEditorDialog set, plus
the scrolling added.
My newish goal is a fully-featured icon-editing program (gradually more
fully-featured at least). I will be putting the end result in a QMainWindow,
which means menus, toolbar, and status bar. also potentially docking
widgets - I'm thinking zoom... and.... maybe abandon ARGBSetterWidget and
put these in the docking bar? at least zoom and dimensions.


In addition to the colored button, I want a colored frame (it can be smallish),
indicating the currently selected color.

Another cool idea for later functionality to add is shape creators, like
circles, rectangles, straight lines, etc.
Another would be a color palette designer, or at least the ability to switch
the button color and the button text color for a complementary color.

One of the first things I need to implement is save and load funcitonality.

I also need a cool name!
